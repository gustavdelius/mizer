* Improvements made to the speed by evaluating convolution sums via fft


mizer 0.3

* Improvements made to the speed of the simulations. Remaining bottle necks are the sweep statements in getPhiPrey() and getPredRate().
* Moved tests to new suggested folder.
* Minor changes to documentation to pass new check requirements.

mizer 0.2
-----------

* Release to coincide with the submission of the MEE paper. No major changes. Just minor bug fixes.


mizer 0.1

* Beta release - just about works but still some gremlins to sort out.
  There are a number of features I'd like to add in the coming relases.
